    content:"Our Carnatic music program offers young learners a joyful introduction to the world of classical South Indian music, focusing on building a strong foundation in melody, rhythm, and voice training. Children are guided through the basics of swaras (notes), simple ragas, and beginner-level songs such as geethams and bhajans in a fun and engaging environment. With personalized attention and interactive sessions, our experienced instructors help students develop musical sensitivity, discipline, and confidence. This program not only nurtures their talent but also instills a deep appreciation for the rich tradition of Indian classical music from an early age.",
